        <p><b> Ages 1-10 years old</b> <br>
        
        I was born in Phoenix, Arizona during the summer. I have two older sisters a mom and a dad.  After about two weeks my
        father accepted a job that relocated us to Oxford, North Carolina. The change in climate was very <b> intense </b>.
        After about two years my father was promoted which <i>required</i> us to move to Jacksonville, Florida. I resided here for
        about 7 years. My favorite things to do were  surf, play soccer. Eventually my father was given another promotion which 
        relocated my family back to Phoenix, Arizona. 


        <p><b> Ages 10-20 years old</b> <br>

        In early 2000s I found a passion for riding my bicycle and was often racing other kids on courses in the desert. When I
        started highschool as a freshman I met a girl and we started dating. We finished highschool together and were still dating. 
        My passion eventually changed from racing bicycles to modifying cars and playing video games as I grew up and obtained my
        drivers license.

        <p><b> Ages 20-25 years old</b>   <br>

        In my twenties I was going to college working different jobs to help pay for college and still interested in cars and
        video games. In the summer of 2017 I married my highschool sweetheart in Scottsdale, Arizona. Shortly after that we 
        relocated to Omaha, Nebraska  because my wife was accepted into medical school at <abbr title="University of Nebraska 
        Medical Center">UNMC</abbr>. We are both in our final year of school and look forward to making money instead of borrowing
        money.

     <h1> Education </h1>

     <p><b> College</b> <br> <br> 

        In 2011 I was accepted into <abbr title="University of Arizona">UofA</abbr> to study Molecular and Cellular Biology
        and Physiology. After finishing I started working at a human tissue bank and was not happy with what I was doing.
        This became a  catalyst for me to get a degree in something I was more passionate about. After much research I found the 
        <abbr title="Management Information Systems">MIS</abbr> program at
        <abbr title="University of Nebraska Omaha">UNO</abbr> and I have one year left until I complete that degree. 
        I have a couple different avenues to choose as far as employment since I find two things very interesting. I like
        medical device development so creation of robotic assisted surgeries is interesting to me as well as working at a company like
        Raytheon who is contracted by the <abbr title="Department of Defense">DOD</abbr>.
